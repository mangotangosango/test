In December 2022, I had the sudden urge to create my first ever blogging website where I could discuss topics I'm passionate about. There were many options available to create a website, including WordPress and Medium. It was difficult at first to find the perfect one for me. I wanted a platform that was cost-efficient, flexible, and allow me to mold it into a design that truly reflected my style. I've considered using Wordpress, however, its high expenses and their limited capabilities as a free tier held me back.

I came across my favorite Youtuber NetworkChuck's youtube
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUz3E9AW0w) on creating a website. His video was completely straightforward and thanks to him, I was able to successfully created my first-ever website using [000webhost.com](https://www.000webhost.com/). At first, I was proud of the website i created and loved the idea of establishing an online identity for myself with it. However, as time passed, I began to dislike the basic and limited design and decided to start from scratch again by going onto my second website-building adventure. 

I learned about static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which were open-source framework used for building static websites with file-based content. The concept of using codes to create a website intrigued me, so I decided to give Hugo a try. I chose the [Contrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) theme as my first Hugo theme because it had a dark theme and appealing design. As a complete beginner in website development, I had to rely on YouTube tutorials for step-by-step guidance. When the tutorials were difficult for me to follow, I had to consult the documentation and Google alot. I've gone through a lot of failed attempts and error that led me lost and hopeless. Eventually, I successfully created my second website, and I felt proud of my accomplishment. But again, after a few hours of just looking at the website, I realized I didn't like it and decided to explore different Hugo themes.

I went through a lot of theme changes, hoping to find this one theme that I felt satified with. However, I never was satisfied and my limited web development skills didn't help through my journey. I struggled with tasks like adjusting the shade color of the dark mode or changing from ProfileMode to HomeMode. Despite relying heavily on YouTube tutorials. Eventually, I made the decision to prioritize a peaceful life and avoid unnecessary struggles by seeking out a platform that was easier to work on. After all, my main goal was to create a blog and focus on blogging and not getting aught up with these complex web tasks.

That's how I reconsidered WordPress again.

In January 2023, I made the decision to switch to WordPress.com as my blogging platform. Although it had a lot of limitations, especially in the free version, it fulfilled my main goal of writing blog posts. For a long time, WordPress was my bloggin platform.

In May 2023, I was frustrated with the number of ads appearing on my WordPress website. I never liked them so I contemplated on either pretending they did not exist or upgrading to a paid version. On top of that, I tried not to customize a lot in my wordpress since a lot of their features required premium upgrades. I was having second thoughts on returning back to using Hugo themes, especially the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, but was it worth struggles, misery and angst?

In mid-June 2023, I decided to give creating a website with Hugo and the PaperMod theme another try. I did have previous experience with Hugo themes and was better at terminal compared to before so the process have been much easier. The smooth process was a bit surprising to me; it reminded me how much I've gotten better with web development with Hugo compared to my first time. With a little guidance from the Hugo documentation, I was able to successfully create for myself a personal blog website that had more flexibility to style the website as I preferred it. I did, however, struggle a bunch with deploying my website to Github Pages. 

Overall, this journey has been a great learning experience for me and I've learned a lot in the process. Hopefully, this time, I stick to this current theme, whether it fit my style or not.
