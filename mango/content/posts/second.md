We’ve all heard about the impact that [phishing attacks](https://www.phishing.org/what-is-phishing) have had, causing detrimental effects on people’s reputation and financial well-being. Unfortunately, with the rise of AI and [NLP](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing), phishing attacks are becoming more convincing and creative. AI’s natural language processing help generate for you any sort of content you desire, including writing emails, which is a perfect tool for phishing attack.

The availability of AI, such as ChatGPT, has made it quite easier for attackers to generate convincing emails. This time, phishing emails are so convincing that they almost look legitimate. We used to easily detect phishing scams through their grammatical and spelling mistakes, however, AI-generated emails are completely free of grammatical mistakes, making it difficult for some to recognize the phishing attempts and protect themselves.

Additionally, it is much quicker to generate emails using AI than it is to type them out by hand. This gives a chance for attackers to create much more phishing emails than they would by typing. Even [Marcus Hutchins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MVczQBk9yo) showed the ease of creating perfect phishing emails using ChatGPT in just a minute.

Given the fact that people are already susceptible to falling for human-generated phishing emails and experiencing unfortunate losses, with the increasing prevalence and deception of AI-generated emails , one can only speculate on the potential impact of this issue and the risks it may pose.

However, despite the challenges by AI, there has been significant progress made in detecting and combating these emails. While attackers use NLP to create emails, NLP can also be used to analyze the contents of an email to identify phishing keywords, unusual language patterns, or social engineering techniques commonly employed in phishing attempts. AI can also analyze phishing patterns, examine images and visual elements, among other capabilities.

On top of that, there have been trainings that provide security awareness to users to help recognize the red flags of phishing techniques and how to spot them. For instance, users are advised to be alert to “urgent” or unexpected emails, regardless of whether they recognize the sender or not. Staying updated with the latest phishing techniques enables users to not only protect themselves but also educate and protect their loved ones.
